# üß† Lung Tumor Classification using Topological Data Analysis

This project applies **Topological Data Analysis (TDA)** ‚Äî particularly **persistent homology** ‚Äî to classify lung CT scan images as **normal**, **benign**, or **malignant**. We extract entropy-based features from both images and point clouds, and compare their classification performance using various machine learning and deep learning models. The top-performing approach achieved **97.67% accuracy** using entropy values from point clouds with a KNN classifier.
